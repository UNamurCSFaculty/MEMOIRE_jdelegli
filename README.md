# Elders rings

This repository contains the main components of the elder-rings server application :

- A keycloak server, to handle authentication (with its own postgre database)
- A quarkus app server, to provide the REST API of the application
- A postregre database to store the application data
- A react application, the frontend application (served by quarkus server with Quinoa)

## Prerequisites

- A docker environement (e.g : Docker desktop)
- Java / Maven (version 21 or higher)
- Node js (version 18 or higher)

## How to run it

Start by setting up the application dependencies to run

```
cd plateform
docker compose up -d
```

This will create an empty database, a keycloak and its database

> /!\ At this point, the keycloak configuration is not part of the build, so you need to create realms, roles and user manually
> This will be included once the configuration is finished

Then you can simply run the backend and frontend by running

```
./dev.ps1
```

If you are not running on windows, you can either make your own script, or use the base command

```
.\mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev
```

## How to use the application

1. Set up keycloak and create users (not documented as it will be automated)
2. Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/elder-rings/
