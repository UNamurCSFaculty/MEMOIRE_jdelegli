This project contains two different project as part of my thesis

1. elder-rings : the server side application, a react vite app with a quarkus backend and docker-compose file for dependencies (keycloak, ...)
2. elder-rings-client : the script running on the client raspberry pi, with raspberry pi installation instructions
